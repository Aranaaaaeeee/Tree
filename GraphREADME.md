The Package Delivery Optimizer models a delivery network as a graph and determines the most efficient route for delivering packages.
This system uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two locations, considering distances as weights.
It is particularly useful for logistics, transportation planning, or even academic purposes.

Models locations as nodes and routes as weighted edges based on distance or cost. 
Computes the shortest and most efficient delivery route between a starting and ending point.
Allows users to dynamically add routes and query the shortest path between various locations.

The idea stemmed from the increasing complexity of logistics in modern supply chains. 
Package delivery, whether for small businesses or global companies, is a critical aspect of commerce, where optimizing delivery routes can save time, money, and resources.
As a learning project, this application is a practical way to understand graph algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s and to apply them to real-world problems.

Small delivery services can use such a system to plan efficient routes. 
Encourages reduced fuel consumption and better resource allocation by optimizing travel routes.
