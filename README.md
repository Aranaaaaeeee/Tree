The Student Manager was developed to address the need for a simple and lightweighted  tool to help organize school data in an educational environment.

Users can add new classses to represent different groups or division within the school. 
Assign students to specific classes, effectively an organized record of which students belong to which classes.
Displays a nested view of the school’s structure, showing classes and their associated students in a clear and readable format.
Provides a simple menu-based interface for easy navigation and operation.

I created this application because I saw a need for something simple and functional to manage students and classes.
I wanted to built a solution that’s easy to use, lightweight, and provides just enough functionality to organize a basic structure.

This tool can be a simple yet effective solution for schools or educators who don’t have access to sophisticated systems.
This application contributes to creating an organized system for managing classes and students.
