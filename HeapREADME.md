A Library Book Reservation System is an application designed to help users (students, faculty, or library members) reserve books from a library online.
It allows users to search for books, view availability, and place a reservation for the books they wish to borrow.
This system is essential for modernizing library operations, making the process of reserving books more efficient and accessible.
Users can search for books by title, author, genre. The system will display the current availability of the books (whether they are checked out or available).

Creating the Library Book Reservation System is to improve library management and user experience.
Many libraries still rely on traditional methods of checking out books and managing reservations, which can be slow and prone to human error. 
This application automates the process, making it quicker and more efficient for both users and librarians.
Libraries can manage their collections and reservations more effectively, reducing wait times and mismanagement of books.
Users can reserve books remotely, eliminating the need for physical visits unless necessary.
The system provides users with a more seamless experience, improving satisfaction and encouraging regular use of library services.
